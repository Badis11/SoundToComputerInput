# SoundToComputerInput
 This program analyzes sound from microphone and changes it to computer input to act as keyboard. Currently in development

# Usage
In order to use it open "controller ready.py". In order to change what different music notes do change the PyAutoGui code in every "if"/"elif"/"else".

# Important Notes
Remember to set your default microphone setting to the microphone you would like to record.
For better experience use this code in IDE.

 # Requirements
Pyaudio, Wave, Numpy, Scipy, PyAutoGui
